# Cancer-Prediction-model-GUI-
This repo contains python and ml model using tk inter to predict cancer type.

This model dosent aim at machine learning , it majorly aims at python and TKinter.
For machine learning it uses knn algo.

TKinter : Graphical user interface for python code

K-Nearest Neighbors:
Basic Idea is to predict the label of a data point by looking at the 'k' closest labeled data point,
taking the majority vote.
